          Homemade Sloppy Joes don't have to be difficult to eat. Despite the name of this iconic<br>retro dish, the secret to a great Sloppy Joe is a thick, rich, almost dry consistency, which<br>allows the sandwich to be eaten with your hands. Serve on hamburger buns.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 green pepper, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¾ cup ketchup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 dash Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 1</strong><br>
            Place ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until beef is browned<br>and crumbled, about 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 2</strong><br>
            Stir in green pepper and garlic; cook and stir until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 cup water and stir,<br>scraping the pan to dissolve any brown flavor bits from the bottom of the skillet.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 3</strong><br>
            Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, salt, black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Add remaining<br>1 cup water and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid has<br>evaporated and mixture is thick, about 40 minutes
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 4</strong><br>
            Season with salt, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper.
