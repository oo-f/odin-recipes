            There are so many versions of banana puddingâ€”or puddin', as we call it.<br> 
            This one allows you to make it from scratch like we do and always have,<br> 
            just like our mama and our grandmas and our aunts used to do. Just be sure to make enough!<br>
            After putting in the effort, you don't want to be the one to go, "Where's the banana pudding? I missed it!"

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>9 ripe bananas</li>
            <li>2 (12 ounce) boxes vanilla wafers</li>
            <li>6 egg whites</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 1</strong><br>
            Stir together 1 cup sugar, the flour, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in milk, egg yolks, and whole eggs until well combined and smooth.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 2</strong><br>
            Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour milk mixture into saucepan with butter; reduce heat to medium-low and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened, coats the back of a spoon nicely, and begins to bubble, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla. Cover and let custard cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. (It will continue to thicken as it cools.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 3</strong><br>
            Peel and slice bananas. Line the bottom and sides of 2 (9x13-inch) broiler-safe casserole dishes with vanilla wafers. Layer banana slices over wafers. Pour cooled custard over bananas and wafers, smoothing top with a knife or spatula.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 4</strong><br>
            For meringue, in a large clean bowl, using an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla at high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Spoon meringue over top of custard, covering it completely.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 5</strong><br>
            Set oven rack about 4 inches from broiler; turn broiler to high. Quickly broil meringues until browned, about 1 to 2 minutes. (This happens very quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 6</strong><br>
            Remove dishes from oven, allow meringue to cool slightly, about 15 minutes, and serve. (Chill, covered, up to 4 days.)
