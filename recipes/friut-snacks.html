          If you are concerned that your kids eat too many sweets during Halloween, try these<br> non-candy snacks. Dried and fresh fruit like apricots, mangoes, and grapes are so much<br> more appealing when they look at you!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces dried apricots</li>
            <li>4 ounces dried peaches</li>
            <li>½ pound seedless green grapes, halved</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
            <li>¼ cup small candy eyeballs</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 1</strong><br>
            Arrange apricots and peaches on a platter. Skewer a few grapes on a toothpick vertically and the last one<br> horizontally (for the head).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 2</strong><br>
            Mix confectioners' sugar with water to make a thin, slightly sticky icing. Use icing to glue 2 candy eyeballs on<br> each piece of fruit and on the horizontal "head" of the grape caterpillar.
