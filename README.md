# odin-recipes

This is my first project. Just started to learn how to code, following The Odin Project!

This is a simple recipe site. Demonstrating Git knowledge for commits, file organization, some html, and some css. I'll purposefully be committing frequently to show a clear roadmap of the project and to get better at using Git commands.
